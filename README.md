# Memories

I've designed a basic social media portal where users may make their own accounts and share their memorable moments with other users. Users can like and comment on other users' postings, as well as change their own.

 **Tech Stack used:** 
      React, Redux for state management, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Material-UI, Firebase for google authentication, Redux-thunk, Jsonwebtoken & Bcryptjs for encrypting and decrypting information between client and server, REST APIs

### Steps to run the web app:

* First use ```npm install``` to install concurrently
* Use ```npm install-server``` to install dependencies in server
* Use ```npm install-client```  to install dependencies in client
* Use ```npm run server``` to start server
* Use ```npm run client``` to start client
