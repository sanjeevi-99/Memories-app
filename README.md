I have created simple social media page where user can create their own account and they can share their unforgettable in life to other user. Users can like and comment on other user's posts and they can edit their own post as well.

 Tech Stack used: 
      React, Redux for state management, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Material-UI, Firebase for google authentication, Redux-thunk, Jsonwebtoken & Bcryptjs for encrypting and decrypting information between client and server, REST APIs

### Steps to run the web app:

First use ```npm install``` to install concurrently

Use ```npm install-server``` to install dependencies in server

Use ```npm install-client```  to install dependencies in client

Use ```npm run server``` to start server

Use ```npm run client``` to start client
